###### Finding Valleys/subpeaks from enhancers for motifs and CRC analysis
###### This program is modified from Charles Y. Lin CRC program: https://github.com/linlabcode/CRC
#modified by Zhen You
###### This can be normaly installed through python and only used for calling subpeaks/valleys inside enhancers

# Installation:

python setup.py install


# prerequisite: Please refer to the original CRC program for details: https://github.com/linlabcode/CRC


# Usage:
crc -e enhancers_table -c reference_chr_genome -g genome -o output_dir -n sample_ID -b input_bam


# input:
enhancers_table: enhancers table generated by ROSE2
genome: genome build by CRC program: HG19, HG38, MM10, RN6
reference_chr_genome: path to folder with seperate chrmosome fasta files
output_dir: designated output folder
sample_ID: sample ID
input_bam: input bam files


# output:
${sample_ID}_all_subpeak.bed: bed file for all valleys/subpeaks regions
${sample_ID}_all_subpeak.fa: fasta sequences for all valleys/subpeaks regions
